# iru-tools

This repository contains a collection of tools for the Information Systems Management course at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

This work is meant to be used by me as it contains the solutions to the assignments. If you are a student of the course, please do not copy the solutions, but try to solve the problems yourself.
However, since this is code licensed under the GPL v3, you are free to use the code for your own purposes.

The repository is public to make it easier for me to use it on the actual course.

## Usage

You'll have to create a `.neptun` file in your home directory containing your NEPTUN code. The file should contain only the code, nothing else.

```bash
echo "ABC123" > ~/.neptun
```
